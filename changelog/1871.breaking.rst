The signature of `~plasmapy.formulary.relativity.relativistic_energy`
has changed. The parameter ``m`` has been replaced with ``particle``,
which now accepts a broader variety of |particle-like| arguments,
including but not limited to a |Quantity| representing mass. The
parameter ``v`` has been replaced with ``V`` for consistency with other
functionality.
