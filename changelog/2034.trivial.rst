Modified |particle_input| to allow |CustomParticle|\ -like objects with
a defined charge to be passed through to decorated functions when a
|parameter| to that function annotated with |ParticleLike| is named
``ion``. Previously, only |Particle| objects representing ions or
neutral atoms were allowed to pass through when the parameter was named
``ion``.
